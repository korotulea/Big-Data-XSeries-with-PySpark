<h1>Big Data XSeries</h1>

<p>School: BerkeleyX through EdX</p>
<p>Instructor: Anthony D. Joseph</p>
<p>Industry partner: Databricks</p>

<p>The Big Data XSeries was created in partnership with Databricks. It articulates the expected output of Data Scientists and then teachs students how to use PySpark (part of Apache Spark) to deliver against these expectations. It is also present an integrated view of data processing by highlighting the various components of these pipelines, including exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, supervised learning, and model evaluation. Students gains hands-on experience applying big data principles using Apache Spark, a cluster computing system well-suited for large-scale machine learning tasks.</p>

<p>This XSeries requires a programming background and experience with Python. All exercises use PySpark (part of Apache Spark). Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts and exposure to algorithms, probability, linear algebra and calculus are prerequisites for the second course in this series. </p>

<p>This XSeries consists of 2 courses:
